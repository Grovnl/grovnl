              The color scheme: We chose for a color palette with high contrast colors for a unique and defined look.  <em>&nbsp;</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #350f92;"> </span> #350f92&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Purple, has these same powers, this time a hard contrast with the color yellow as they are on opposite sides of the color wheel, it is a choice made for hard edges. And once used with black makes for a good match because of their dark nature. Purple also conveys the feeling of Passion which is our main value. <em>&nbsp;</em> </li>
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #fae34d ;"> </span> #fae34d<em>&nbsp;</em> </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Yellow being a bright color, it has a high contrast to the black resulting in hard changes of color, besides, yellow is a color that conveys energy and joy. These emotions are highly connected to Expression which is one of our main values.</li>
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #424141 ;"> </span> #424141<em>&nbsp;</em> </li>
            <li>&nbsp;We chose for a color palette with high contrast colors for a unique and defined look. Black, the primary color is widely used by the target audience because of its dark nature that aligns with message of the music (hard rock). We want to make use of this dark grey to have a color that we can use to compensate for the harsh contrasts here and there.&nbsp;</li>

            <p>Cheddar gothic rough: as the name suggests itself this fount is very rough. It is a font that mimics the imperfect nature of stencils. As it is see through it gives it a texture that conveys the hardness that the target audience is found of.   </p>
			<p> Bebas Neue: A font that is often used for its harness. It has very angular shapes that makes for a hard contrast with its surrounding background. This contrast also ensures it’s legibility.  </p>
			<p> Open sans: The open sans font is used for its highly legible nature and is therefore a perfect font for paragraphs and bigger pieces of text.  </p>
              
			  <!-- Start User interface patterns -->
		    <li>User interface patterns</li>
		 	<p> <strong>Home page: </strong> On the homepage we chose for a big logo as the first thing a visitor sees, along with and explanation of what our website is, so that they immediately know both where they are and what to expect. As they scroll down, they will see a two-column grid with a picture that illustrates what they could be. Along with our slogan and a call-to-action button to learn more about us as a Brand. Next to it our 4 values in a big header font.  All these choices were made for the visitor to know who we are and what we stand for. But also, for them to know how we can help them achieve what they want.</p>
		 	
			<p>Our visitors will most likely be niche in search for what we can offer. We want them to know that they are in the right place. The next section, explains to the visitor how it works. In order to see this section of the website you would have to scroll down, which indicates a first degree of interest as they start looking further. Here we chose for the brighter color of our palette for a more legible experience as we are more used to reading black on white than white on black. We chose for two columns lay out with two titles and subtitles so that it is clear for the visitor which part of the text they have to read that aligns with why they are visiting our website. This way they do not have to read big paragraphs that do not give them the information they are searching for.</p>
			  
			<p>Once they have read about 150 words explaining them how it works and they are still interested to scroll further, it brings them to a call to action. A section with popular venues in they area. A card grid was chosen instead of a list format so that these venues would feel important. In this way a band that visits our website feels like they get the chance to play at venues that feel important. And a venue that wants to join, knows that their venue will be on the front page if they are popular enough.  The “book now” button is mean to convey a sense of urgency for the visitor to want to immediately book these venues.  Finally, a footer with the chance to visit our Social Media channels. </p>
			  
			<p> <strong>About us:</strong> This page is accessible via the button in the home page or in the navigation bar. The goal for this page is less “in your face” and although keeping the style of the website gives the visitor an opportunity to take their time to read who we are as a team and a brand. The use of our brand name and slogan, just like on the home pages, makes the visitor read this twice with makes it more memorable.  </p>
		 	
			<p>The purple background of the “About us” section in mean to lead the visitor’s eye toward that section with its contrast the otherwise mostly black page. As that is the information, they clicked on to get to it is one of the first things we want them to read. A less important font is used for the values, vision and mission as we want the visitor to take their time to read about what we stand for.</p>
			  
			<p>At the bottom of the page, a card system that presents the team. This was chosen so that we could include photos, for a more personal feeling and a connection with the visitor. </p>
			  
			<p> <strong>Navigation bar: </strong> We chose for a simple navigation bar; it only contains three buttons. We didn’t want the visitor to feel pushed to immediately navigate through our website, but rather look at the home page first. This is also why the “home” button is the only one in bold.  </p>

     <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
		<p> This testing report was designed to test the website of GrovNL, a new website that provides the opportunity for upcoming hard rock stars get the opportunity to show their talent, and for pub owners to easily find available bands to perform. This happens through an online portfolio.  </p>
		<p> <strong> Testing Goals: </strong> </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Evaluate the level of clarity of information shared on the website. </li>
				<li> To make sure the website matches the criteria. </li>
				<li> Assess the navigation and overall user experience. </li>
				<li> Gather layout and website content feedback. </li>
				<li> To identify errors </li>
		  </ul>
		<p> <strong> Testing Method: </strong> </p>
		  <p> The testing rounds were done by five participants who match our target group: Teun (artist), Bram (Pub owner), Mathijs (artist), Tom (hard-rock fan), Bart (Artist). Different segments of our target group as you can see. They are all aged between 20 and 35 and have high usability experience in using websites.  </p>
		  <p> The testing rounds were done online via Teams or physically. In the online call, the screen of the tester was shared to see what they did. The person who instructed them also analyzed their actions. </p>
		  <p> <strong>Performance: </strong> We asked our participants to check every page of the website without any long loading images or different types of errors. 
			  <strong>Accessibility: </strong> We asked our participants to go to the lean canvas, what the name is of the girl with the brown hair (they should go to ‘about us’ and see it’s Elise), and visit our Instagram account. 
		  	  <strong>Functionality: </strong> We asked our participants if the values of our brand match our website and if in their opinion the style was coherent on every page (including title fonts, sizes, etc.)</p>
		<p> <strong>Findings </strong></p>
			<ll> 
				<li>The performance of our website turned out very well for each participant. No errors occurred. </li>
				<li>The accessibility: four of our participants told us the website is logically designed, one participant clicked on the logo to go back to the home page but that did not work. </li>
				<li>We heard from three out of the five participants that they missed some details and nice elements, the elements on our website now are only functional. </li> 
				<li>All participants agreed that the fonts are easily readable and a good choice. </li> 
				<li>All participants told us the colors were matching with hard rock. Two of them told that they liked the fact of not using the ‘standard’ hard rock red color, it would make us less original.  </li>
		  </ll>
			
			
		<p> <strong>Suggested improvements </strong></p>
			<ll> 
				<li> Make the left upper corner logo clickable to navigate to the home page as this is very common on websites. </li>
				<li> Add more frills to make it less ‘flat.’ </li> 
		  </ll>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>The goal of this social media campaign was to create a community of online users that could be interested in our product. We kept our target audience in mind while posting always, making sure we would reach the right people. The plan was to create a group of engaged people within the Hardrock scene by letting them engage as much as possible together. We would try to achieve this by posting fun reels and asking people questions in the descriptions of our posts.</p>
          <p>We created accounts on both Instagram and Facebook, looking at our two different persona's. We posted the same content for both Instagram and Facebook, because of the fact that a lot of reels watched on Facebook and Instagram are found on the same sources (This is not a good idea, read more about it in the learning points).</p>
			<p> The activities we executed displayed in our social media content calendar, for that please see appendix 5
          </p>
          <p>Our objectives for this campaign are as following:</p>
		  <p><strong>Reach objective </strong>
            <ll> 
		  <li> Instagram: We want to reach 10.000 accounts within 30 days. This means that in our content we will be focusing on a call to action that gets people to interact with the posts (Comment/share)</li>
		  <li> Facebook: We want to reach 50 people per post within 30 days.</li>
			  </ll>
			</p>
          <p><strong>Affect: </strong></p>
          <p>We want our target audience to feel like they are a part of a hard rock community. This will ensure that they are getting prepared for our platform, having made some connections online already. We will post funny content and content with a nostalgic sense, but balancing that with also showing new faces to create that modern feel.</p>
              
          <p><strong>Response </strong></p> 
			<p> <ll> 
		  <li>Instagram: the objective is to have 100 followers on Instagram. In our eyes, this goal is realistic for the amount of time we have and since we are not using paid advertisements it is enough of a challenge to reach this. </li>
            	<li>Facebook: the objective is to have 75 followers. This goal is fewer followers than on Instagram because the target audience is less on their phones and Facebook is more saturated. </li></ll>
              </p>
		  <p><strong>Media tactics </strong></p>
		  		<p> <ll> 
		  <li>We want to use Instagram and Facebook since our interviews showed us that they use Instagram and Facebook the most. Our research has also shown us that 30% of Instagram users are between 18 and 24 years old, and 39,5% of all Facebook users are above 45 years old (see appendix 2 and 3). These are the age groups that allign with our target audience. </li>
            	<li>We want to post the same content on Instagram as on Facebook as the content that is shown on both platforms is mostly coming from TikTok. Also the target group on Facebook is different than on Instagram what will show us different results (again, see learning points on why this is not smart).  </li></ll>
              </p>
<!--Start learning points-->
<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
		<p> During our campaign, we learned a lot and had several eye-openers. In general, we are still neutral about hashtags as some posts without hashtags reached well, and others didn’t, and vice versa. We are quite surprised with some outcomes and overall we underestimated the effort to put in a social media campaign!  </p>
	<p><strong>What worked? </strong></p>
		<p> Instagram: Instagram did a good job. We did not achieve our goal of 10.000 accounts total reach, but after a rough start with not much reach, we gained more by posting more videos and ended up with in total reach of 6.000 people. We also think that Instagram worked better because we are familiar with it, and less familiar with Facebook.  </p>
		<p> The group dynamics: It was very pleasant to work with this group, everyone was eager to start this campaign and had nice ideas for posts. We all were open to changes and experimenting with posting despite it would change our social media planning, it was never a problem! </p>
		<p>Following random people: On Instagram, we started following several accounts within the hard-rock scene and that worked very well. Different accounts started to follow us back. </p>
	<p><strong>What did not work? </strong></p>
	    <p>Equal posting division: At the beginning of our campaign, we decided that we would rotate the responsibility for posting every day. Our planning shows who’s responsible for what day for what post. However, at the beginning of this project, we noticed that some of our groupmates forgot to post. In a company situation we maybe should point to just one person who is responsible for posting, but to keep the project effort equal we chose to do all four. The learning point here was to really plan your posting day and even plan the whole post via a planner tool. However, after the first week of some forgotten posts and a warning, we all started taking it seriously and it went well for the rest of the weeks.  </p>
		<p> Facebook: <ll> <li>Expectations: We expected that Facebook would reach the elderly segment of our target group. We had these expectations because of the interviews we did, the older interviewees told us they use Facebook as the most used social media platform. </li></ll> 
		  <ll> <li>Reality: In week 7 (after 2 weeks of posting) we did a reflection moment, we checked our Facebook and we saw that it still did not get any views or followers. We decided to make the Facebook content separate from the Instagram content and to have some difference in the time of posting. We asked Chat GPT to come up with some ideas for posts on Facebook and we made use of it. We adjusted our calendar: we made new cells for all the Facebook post information. We started posting ‘photo’ posts for 4 days but it did not work, from that moment (24-3-2024) we decided to post only videos, and this worked better! From the moment we started posting videos, we finally had some views, not much, but at least some! The average reach per Facebook post became 15 people. However, this is not even almost what we wanted, we now do know that Facebook works differently than Instagram, and in the future, we should try out more where our target is on Facebook. </li></ll></p>
		<p>Time of posting: At the beginning of the posting process, we decided to post every day around 17:00. After one week of some forgotten posts, we saw that the videos that were posted later in the evening did better for reach. </p>

<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>We started out using Instagram and Facebook to reach both of our primary target audiences. Instagram for bands that consist of mainly younger people and Facebook for bar owners that are mainly older people. </p>
		<ll> <li> Facebook: as mentioned earlier in the learning outcomes, Facebook did not work out very well for us. Therefore, we think for the future it is better to either do extensive research on what content to create for Facebook users or leave Facebook for what it is and find a different strategy to target the older bar owners. This could be through a different media than social media like for example direct mail or flyers. </li></ll>
		<ll> <li> Instagram: from the different types of posts, reels seemed to work out best for us so in the future this should be our primary focus on Instagram. The content of the reels were mainly reposts, and we haven’t created any original content so in the future we should look more specifically into the content of the reels, and if there is something more effective than simply reposting. Timing wise we realized that later in the evening works better and we should keep doing this. Hashtags are a waste of time, and we should not spend much time and effort on aligning them or keeping consistency. </li></ll>
			<p> In general: </p> 
				<ll> <li>More research has to be done for creating original content that is attractive for our target audience. </li>
					<li>Create different content on each medium.  </li>
					<li>Do not approach both target groups the same way. </li> </ll>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>
			  <ul> 
				  <li> Positive portrait: Hard rock fans face a lot of negative stereotypes that are hold against them. They are often seen as violent and aggressive while this is in most cases the opposite. By creating a platform to show the positive attributes of hard rock fans, this negative stereotype can be broken. This can include showing their passion for music or their community spirit in concert videos. </li>
				  <li>Joined transport to concerts: Concerts are often far away, and most hard rock fans like to drink alcohol at a party. Leaving them unable to drive a car and having to take public transport. This can be inconvenient since they have to leave the concert early to catch a train. If there is a way for hard rock fans to meet people from there are to share a car, this problem can be bypassed. </li>
				  <li> Decreasing popularity: The hard rock genre is not as popular as it has been, especially in the USA. Most popular hard rock bands are older bands from the 70’s and 80’s. A hard rock fan base to promote the hard rock genre could increase the popularity again.</li>
